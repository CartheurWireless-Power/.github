## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Wireless Power Research Laboratory

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - We develop novel hardware and software leading to ideal computing devices that have a _managed_ Ai through how we leverage ML. We use this research to propose personal robots that are interactive and adapt to you over the time that you interact with them. Our AGI is called _aeon_ and is embodied into three different robotic scenes:

- huggable
- henry
- fred
- david

Each of these forms are in separate repositories and have public-released code that you can experiment with and contribute, if you are so inclined.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - If you would like to get involved, send us a contact message at cartheur-research@pm.me.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - There is a lot in here. You can see our idea of a new kind of fundamental computer, our efforts on innovating with the _x09_ architecture, our new fred/henry computer project, and software for interactive robotic platforms.

🍿 Fun facts - We started in 2022 but our development history, experience, and knowledge stretches back to 1979. Origin stories are collected in various places on the Internet.

🧙 We are here to help artificial intelligence and human-necessary processes be integrated for maximum benefit and not for a dystopian vision.
